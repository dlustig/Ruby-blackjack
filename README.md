Ruby-blackjack
==============

This is a very simple version of blackjack written in the language Ruby.

The goal of the card game is to attain the score 21 without going over. You are not playing against a dealer.

I wrote this in about 45 minutes in support to a paper on Ruby's functionality and to learn Ruby's syntax. So be easy, I wasn't going for huge functionality. If anything, this is more of a working prototype.


Instructions:

1. Download Ruby's framework from their website
2. run this program in terminal with the command " blackjack.rb "
